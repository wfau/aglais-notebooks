      "title": "Spark aspects",
      "text": "%md\n\nThe operating model of Spark as actioned via a workflow expressed in a notebook will be unfamiliar to many. Users should be aware of the following basic facts from the outset:\n\n__Lazy Evaluation:__ Spark employs \"lazy evaluation\" of jobs: nothing happens until the last possible point in the workflow. For example, a notebook cell may contain a data frame defined by a query \n\n    df \u003d spark.sql(\"select * from gaia_source\")\n\nbut as far as Spark is concerned this is simply a definiton, or \"transformation\", of a data resource. If nothing is done with the data frame defined by that query in the cell, then the cell will appear to run instantaneously. Only if an \"action\" is made on the data frame subsequently will physical execution take place. This means, for example, that if a cell contains a run-time error this may not show up until a later cell is executed with the exception trace explaining the error appearing in that later cell\u0027s output (as opposed to any output associated with the cell containing the source of the error). Note also that the statement above, on it\u0027s own, will not result in the entire billon+ row, ~100 column, tera-byte scale data set being loaded into memory. Whatever is expressed in subsequent transformations (e.g. SQL \"where\" clauses) and actions (e.g. aggregations) will result is \"filter push-down\" optimisations that result in only those data needed to action the process being read into memory and processed.  \n\n__Caching:__ Actions expressed in a cell may need to be re-executed if needed as part of the execution plan for actions in a subsequent cell. This may result in expensive operations being repeatedly executed when developing notebook workflows and working on cells in isolation. You can tell Spark to cache a data frame explicitly to avoid this and speed-up significantly subsequent cell operations\n\n    df \u003d spark.sql(\"select column_1, column_2, ... from gaia_source where ...\").cache()\n    \nbut obviously this should only be done within reason and with due regard to the amount of local memory/disk required by the worker nodes: make sure you only cache what you really need. For further details see [this useful article on best practice with Spark caching](https://towardsdatascience.com/best-practices-for-caching-in-spark-sql-b22fb0f02d34). Some of the example notebooks provided use caching to expedite the execution of cells that re-use data frames.\n\n__Indexing:__ The data hosted on this platform are arranged by gaia_source.source_id as the primary unique identifier in Gaia Data Releases. This key should be employed when joining distinct data sets, e.g. pre-computed best neighbours from external survey catalogues - see the \"Data holdings\" notebook. It can also be used to pull out specific records quickly:\n\n    spark.sql(\"select * from gaia_source where source_id \u003d ...\").show()\n   \nOtherwise, the general RDBMS paradigm employing SQL indexes to optimise execution plans of queries predicated on certain columns has no equivalent on here.

Users should be aware of the following basic facts from the outset:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLazy Evaluation:\u003c/strong\u003e Spark employs \u0026ldquo;lazy evaluation\u0026rdquo; of jobs: nothing happens until the last possible point in the workflow. For example, a notebook cell may contain a data frame defined by a query \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003edf \u003d spark.sql(\u0026quot;select * from gaia_source\u0026quot;)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut as far as Spark is concerned this is simply a definiton, or \u0026ldquo;transformation\u0026rdquo;, of a data resource. If nothing is done with the data frame defined by that query in the cell, then the cell will appear to run instantaneously. Only if an \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; is made on the data frame subsequently will physical execution take place. This means, for example, that if a cell contains a run-time error this may not show up until a later cell is executed with the exception trace explaining the error appearing in that later cell\u0026rsquo;s output (as opposed to any output associated with the cell containing the source of the error). Note also that the statement above, on it\u0026rsquo;s own, will not result in the entire billon+ row, ~100 column, tera-byte scale data set being loaded into memory. Whatever is expressed in subsequent transformations (e.g. SQL \u0026ldquo;where\u0026rdquo; clauses) and actions (e.g. aggregations) will result is \u0026ldquo;filter push-down\u0026rdquo; optimisations that result in only those data needed to action the process being read into memory and processed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCaching:\u003c/strong\u003e Actions expressed in a cell may need to be re-executed if needed as part of the execution plan for actions in a subsequent cell. This may result in expensive operations being repeatedly executed when developing notebook workflows and working on cells in isolation. You can tell Spark to cache a data frame explicitly to avoid this and speed-up significantly subsequent cell operations\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003edf \u003d spark.sql(\u0026quot;select column_1, column_2, ... from gaia_source where ...\u0026quot;).cache()\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut obviously this should only be done within reason and with due regard to the amount of local memory/disk required by the worker nodes: make sure you only cache what you really need. For further details see \u003ca href\u003d\"https://towardsdatascience.com/best-practices-for-caching-in-spark-sql-b22fb0f02d34\"\u003ethis useful article on best practice with Spark caching\u003c/a\u003e. Some of the example notebooks provided use caching to expedite the execution of cells that re-use data frames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIndexing:\u003c/strong\u003e The data hosted on this platform are arranged by gaia_source.source_id as the primary unique identifier in Gaia Data Releases.
