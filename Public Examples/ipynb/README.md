# IPython (Jupyter) versions of the Gaia DMP example notebooks
The notebook files in this folder are IPython (Jupyter) compatible versions of the Gaia
DMP public examples (as contained in the parent folder in json format for an Apache 
Zeppelin notebook interface). These are provided for convenience for interested parties
who do not have access to a system running a Zeppelin UI.

If you would like to preview the documentation and code encapsulated in these example 
notebooks in a Jupyter interface then simply upload the relevant .ipynb file 
contained here as follows:
1. In Jupyter use the Upload button in the file explorer homepage "Click to browse for a file to upload." and select the ipynb file
2. Click the "Upload" button
3. Launch the notebook by clicking on the resulting file entry in the Jupyter file explorer; if a pop-up appears saying "Kernel not found" you can set the (Python3) interpreter or "Continue Without Kernel" to at least view and edit the markup and code in the imported notebook.

Note that results output like plots previously rendered by Zeppelin will not appear in the resulting Jupyter notebook. Obviously the examples will not be executable on arbitrary platforms without the necessary underlying data and software infrastructure.
