It is only when something is done with the data selected by this transform (i.e. it is explicitly actioned as in the following cell) that execution occurs\n* Visualisation takes advantage of HEALPix pixelisation encoded in the Gaia source IDs, and the healpy Python package in conjunction with matplotlib\n* Links are provided in the final cell to the documentation for the packages used, along with other relevant resources.\n\n"
